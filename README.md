Drag and Drop Functionality - README
This repository contains the code for implementing drag and drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Instructions to Run
To run the solution locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

shell
Copy code:
git clone https://github.com/TezzMore/MyProject
Open the cloned repository folder.

Locate the index.html file and double-click to open it in a web browser.

Alternatively, you can run a local web server and access the index.html file through the server's URL.

The web page will open in the browser, and you will be able to see two containers side by side with draggable items in the first container.

Testing the Solution
To test the drag and drop functionality, follow these steps:

Click and hold on an item in the first container.

Drag the item to the second container.

Release the mouse button to drop the item into the second container.

You should see the item being appended to the second container, and a success message will be displayed.

To reset the containers and restore the initial state, click the "Reset" button.

This will clear the second container and reset the first container to its original state.
